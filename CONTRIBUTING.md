## Submitting code

Submitted code should follow these quality guidelines:

These are all checked by GitHub Actions when submitting
a Pull Request.

## Submitting bugs

Awesome. These are your options:

* Add an Issue, with the test that fails
* Submit a Pull Request, where the test is added to the `tests/testthat` folder

Pull Requests should follow the same guidelines as 'Submitting code'.

## Branching policy
